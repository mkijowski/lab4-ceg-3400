# Lab 4 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:

### Task 1: `/home` sweet `/home`

Answer the following:

* What are all CIDR's in use in your home network?
* List all IP addresses that respond to a basic nmap scan: 
* Can you identify all devices on your network?
* How many online accounts and social media platforms are you on
  that hold non-trivial data about you?
* How many of these are critical for your organizations business goals?
* Do you know the Authentication policies of these critical accounts?
  * List all primary and secondary authentication methods for your most 
    important account, including non password related  reset options 
    that might be vulnerable to an attacker.

### Task 2: Guess who

Answer the following:

* My three installed critical software packages are:
  1. first
  2. second
  3. third

* The CPE lookup for these software packages are:
  1. [first cpe](www.first.com)
  2. [second cpe](second.com) 
  3. [third cpe](thrid.com)

* Rank the top 5 potential threat vectors in descending order of importance
  based on how likely they are to cause a negative impact on your organization.
  1. most likely
  2. 
  3. 
  4. 
  5. least likely

* Why might having the CPE lookup for your most critical software be important
  for an organization to mitigate risk?
